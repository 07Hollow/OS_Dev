# Operating System Project

This is a personal project that I started for fun and for educational purposes. The goal is to develop a simple operating system to gain a deeper understanding of how operating systems work.

> **Important Note:**  
> I don’t know if I will ever finish this project. The project started on **March 19, 2025** (I think).
